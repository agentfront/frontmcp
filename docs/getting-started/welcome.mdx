FrontMCP is a TypeScript‑first framework for building production‑ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

- Decorators define servers, apps, tools, providers, adapters, and plugins
- Extensible hook stages let you compose cross‑cutting concerns
- Batteries‑included helpers for authentication, caching, rate limits, and more

What you can build
- A single MCP server that hosts multiple apps (tool collections)
- Apps that expose tools implemented in TypeScript with Zod schemas
- Optional adapters that load tools dynamically (e.g., from an OpenAPI URL)
- Plugins that add capabilities like transparent caching and hook integrations

Key ideas
- libs/common: decorators, metadata, types
- libs/core: the runtime that executes based on the decorated metadata
- @FrontMcp is the entry decorator — pass a config object and your server will boot

Next steps
- Quickstart to spin up a server in minutes
- Learn the core components: servers, apps, tools
- Add authentication (local or remote OAuth)
- Extend with adapters and plugins
