FrontMCP evolves rapidly. Keep your packages aligned to avoid runtime mismatches.

Recommendations
- Pin @frontmcp/* versions together across common, core, adapters, plugins
- Check the changelog and README in this repo
- When upgrading, re-run your local dev server and smoke test tools

Version mismatch errors
- If versions drift, you may see errors like “version mismatch, make sure you have the same version for all @frontmcp/* packages”. Align the versions and reinstall.

Safe upgrade steps
1) Update all @frontmcp/* packages to the same range
2) yarn install
3) Build and run examples (e.g., apps/expenses)
4) Verify tools load and authenticate correctly
