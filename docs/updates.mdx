    >
        FrontMCP 0.1 lands streamlined **Streamable HTTP** transport, scoped **DI-powered invoker** flows, and first-class **adapters/plugins** so you can ship production MCP servers with minimal boilerplate.

        - ⚙️ **Streamable HTTP**: spec-compliant GET/POST with sessions and server-pushed events.
        - 🧩 **Adapters & Plugins**: load tools dynamically (OpenAPI, more coming) and add cross-cutting capabilities like caching.
        - 🪝 **Composable hooks**: fine-grained hooks for auth, rate-limit, logging, and execution transforms.
    </Card>
</Update>

## Versioning policy

For production, **pin exact versions** across all packages:

```bash
# Good
@frontmcp/sdk@0.1.0
@frontmcp/adapters@0.1.0
@frontmcp/plugins@0.1.0
```

<Warning>
    If versions drift, runtime mismatches can occur (e.g., “version mismatch… make sure you have the same version for all @frontmcp/* packages”). Align and reinstall.
</Warning>

<Tip>
    After upgrades: clean install, build, then smoke-test your tools.
