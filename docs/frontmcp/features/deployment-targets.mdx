FrontMCP supports multiple deployment targets out of the box. The same `@FrontMcp` server code deploys to any platform — only the build adapter and infrastructure config change.

| Target | Runtime | Session Storage | Cold Start | Best For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Node.js / Docker** | Long-running | In-memory or Redis | None | Full-featured servers |
| **Vercel** | Serverless | Vercel KV or Redis | ~200ms | Edge-first deployments |
| **AWS Lambda** | Serverless | Redis / DynamoDB | ~500ms | AWS-native infrastructure |
| **Cloudflare Workers** | Edge | KV / Durable Objects | ~5ms | Ultra-low latency |
