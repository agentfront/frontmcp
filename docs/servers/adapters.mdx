Adapters can add tools, resources, or other runtime integrations to an app. A common use is loading tools from an OpenAPI definition at runtime.

OpenAPI Adapter (example)
```
@FrontMcpApp({
  id: 'expenses',
  adapters: [OpenapiAdapter.init({ name: 'expenses', url: 'https://example.com/openapi.json' })],
  tools: [...]
})
```

How it works
- On server startup, the adapter fetches the OpenAPI JSON from the given URL
- Tools are generated and attached to the correct app automatically
- Tools inherit app-level hooks and plugins

Tips
- Use a stable adapter `name` per app
- Combine with auth to protect adapter-fetched tools if needed
- Cache responses or rate-limit via plugins/providers if the source API is slow
