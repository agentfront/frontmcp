Tools are the primary execution units. Define them with the @Tool (aka @FrontMcpTool) decorator from @frontmcp/common. Tools have a name, description, Zod input schema, and an async execute method.

Basic example (conceptual)
```
Tool metadata:
{
  name: 'create-expense',
  description: 'Create an expense record',
  inputSchema: {
    amount: 'number',
    category: 'string'
  }
}

execute(input) => Promise<Output>
```

Caching with the Cache plugin
- When the Cache plugin is installed on an app, tools may opt into caching.
- The plugin extends tool metadata with:
```
cache: true | { ttl?: number; slideWindow?: boolean }
```

Hooks around tools
- Global and app/plugin hooks can intercept tool stages (will/did/around) to add auth, metrics, redaction, etc. See Servers → Hooks.
