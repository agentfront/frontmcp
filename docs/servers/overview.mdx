FrontMCP servers are defined with the @FrontMcp decorator from @frontmcp/common. The runtime in @frontmcp/core bootstraps automatically when the decorated class is imported (serve defaults to true).

Example (based on apps/expenses):
```
@FrontMcp({
  info: { name: 'Expense MCP Server', version: '1.0.0' },
  apps: [/* ExpenseMcpApp2 */],
  http: { port: 3001 },
  logging: { level: 'VERBOSE' },
  auth: {
    type: 'remote', // switch to 'local' for built-in local auth
    name: 'frontegg',
    baseUrl: 'https://autheu.davidantoon.me',
  },
})
class MyMcpSever {}
```

Key options
- info: `{ name, version }`
- apps: array of @FrontMcpApp classes
- http: `{ port = 3001, entryPath = '', hostFactory? }`
  - entryPath adds a prefix to the HTTP JSON-RPC entry for all apps (e.g., '/mcp') so the same host can serve multiple FrontMCP servers
  - hostFactory lets you supply a custom HTTP host implementation (Express/other)
- logging: level, transports, etc.
- auth: choose local or remote OAuth. In multi-app mode you can set a single server-level provider. In split-by-app mode, define auth per app.
- serve: defaults to true; set to false to disable auto-bootstrap
- splitByApp: when true, each app gets its own scope and basePath (served under its own id prefix)

Serving multiple apps
- A single server can host multiple apps (tool collections)
- With splitByApp: true, each app is served under /:appId/...
- Without splitByApp, apps share the same scope and base path

HTTP entry prefix
- Use http.entryPath (e.g., '/frontmcp') to run multiple FrontMCP servers on the same host. Combined with per-app ids, you can neatly namespace everything.
