Resources are read-only surfaces (files, schemas, docs, KBs) that your tools or clients can consume. In FrontMCP, resources can be exposed by apps or plugins.

Typical uses
- Expose a JSON schema or config that tools rely on
- Provide static documentation or templates
- Surface read-only data from providers

How to add
- Some plugins or adapters may register resources automatically
- You can also expose resources from your app using app-level metadata (plugin/provider specific)

Notes
- Resources are namespaced by app when splitByApp is enabled
- Respect authentication/authorization when serving protected resources
