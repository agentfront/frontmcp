Providers supply dependencies and state to apps/tools (e.g., config, DB, Redis, HTTP clients). They can be static or dynamic and have scopes.

Concepts
- Scopes: global (server), app, session, request
- Resolution: tool → app → server, with DI resolving dependencies lazily
- Dynamic providers: factories that compute providers from options

Example (conceptual)
```
// Register providers on an app
@FrontMcpApp({
  id: 'expenses',
  providers: [ExpenseConfigProvider, createRedisProvider, SessionRedisProvider],
  tools: [...]
})
```

Tips
- Keep provider tokens stable and export types for strong typing
- Prefer app-scoped providers for isolation; use global when truly shared
- Use session-scoped providers to carry auth/session context
