title: Local OAuth
slug: servers/authentication/local

Use Local OAuth for development or simple deployments. The FrontMCP server provides a built-in local authorization server.

Server-level config
```
@FrontMcp({
  auth: { type: 'local' },
  apps: [...]
})
```

Behavior
- Tokens are issued by the local server
- Suitable for local runs and low-stakes environments
- You can migrate to Remote later with minimal changes

Tips
- Pair with http.entryPath when hosting multiple servers behind one domain
- Use hooks to enforce per-tool authorization policies
