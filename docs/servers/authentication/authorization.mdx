Authentication verifies identity; authorization decides what an identity can do.

Ways to authorize tool execution
- Hook-based checks at specific stages (will/did/around) per tool or globally
- Provider-driven policies injected into tools
- Per-app scopes when splitByApp is enabled

Example (conceptual)
```
// In a hook: deny if user lacks permission
if (!ctx.user.permissions.includes('expenses:create')) {
  throw new Error('Forbidden');
}
```

Tips
- Keep authorization close to the boundary: early stages of tool execution
- Prefer deny-by-default policies with explicit allow rules
- Log denials with minimal PII for auditing
