Apps are collections of tools, providers, adapters, and plugins. Define an app with @FrontMcpApp and give it a stable id.

Example
```
// App definition (pseudo-code)
@FrontMcpApp({
  id: 'expense-2',
  name: 'Expense MCP 2',
  providers: [ExpenseConfigProvider, createRedisProvider, SessionRedisProvider],
  adapters: [OpenapiAdapter.init({ name: 'expenses', url: 'https://example.com/openapi.json' })],
  plugins: [CachePlugin],
  tools: [CreateExpenseTool],
})
class ExpenseMcpApp {}
```

Register apps on a server
```
@FrontMcp({
  info: { name: 'My Server', version: '1.0.0' },
  apps: [ExpenseMcpApp, ReportsApp],
  // splitByApp: true // optional; when true each app is served under its own base path (/:appId)
})
class MyServer {}
```

Split by app vs multi-app
- splitByApp: true — each app gets its own scope and basePath, served under its id prefix
- splitByApp: false (default) — apps share the same scope and basePath

HTTP entry prefix
- Set http.entryPath (e.g., '/frontmcp') to add a server-wide prefix so you can host multiple FrontMCP servers on the same domain.
