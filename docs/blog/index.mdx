  Anthropic’s “Code execution with MCP” treats tools as code. CodeCall brings that pattern into FrontMCP: hide huge
  toolsets behind a tiny meta-API, let models search and describe tools, then run JavaScript plans in a sandbox that
  call your real tools across multiple apps.

  Why most OpenAPI-to-MCP tools are leaking your credentials, mixing headers between requests, and routing your customer
  tokens through someone else's cloud—and how FrontMCP fixes it with authentication never exposed to clients, request
  isolation guarantees, and security validation out of the box.

  Most SDK examples wire one transport to one client. That collapses when many IDEs, bots, and dashboards need to share
  one server. FrontMCP flips the default: sessions, transport identity, per‑app scoping, auth, DI, and decorators—so a
  single server can safely serve many agents across multiple apps.

        The TypeScript-first framework for building production-grade MCP servers with decorators, DI, and
        Streamable HTTP. If you’ve tried wiring up the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by hand, you already know the drill
        or define JSON schemas manually,...
