Test and debug your FrontMCP server with the **MCP Inspector**. It launches a small proxy plus a web UI where you can browse **tools**, **resources**, and **prompts**, send requests, and see logs.

> The Inspector runs via `npx` and works great with TypeScript servers. You can run against your built JS or your TS entry using `tsx`.

---

## Install (as a dev dependency)

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npm i -D @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn add -D @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add -D @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
    ```

</CodeGroup>

This keeps the Inspector version pinned in your repo. You can still invoke it with `npx` so your local version is used.

---

## Quick start (TypeScript)

Run the Inspector and let it spawn your TS entry with **tsx**:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector tsx src/main.ts
```

Or run against your compiled output:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/main.js
```

- You’ll get a browser UI to connect and exercise your server.
- From the UI you can pick transports and tweak command args/env.

---

## package.json scripts

Add handy scripts for dev and dist builds:

```json package.json (scripts)
{
"scripts": {
    "inspect:dev"
:
    "npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector tsx src/main.ts",
        "inspect:dist"
:
    "npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/main.js"
}
}
```

Run them with your package manager:

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash npm
    npm run inspect:dev
    ```

    ```bash yarn
    yarn inspect:dev
    ```

    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm inspect:dev
    ```

</CodeGroup>

## Tips

- If you change server code, **rebuild** (or re-run `tsx`) and **reconnect** the Inspector.
- Use the UI’s **Tools**, **Resources**, and **Prompts** tabs to validate schemas, try inputs, and preview results.
- Keep logs readable: set `logging.level` in your `@FrontMcp` options.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Server doesn’t start**: make sure your command is correct (e.g., `node dist/main.js` or `tsx src/main.ts`).
- **Auth or transport issues**: double‑check your `http.entryPath`, and verify the transport selected in the UI.
- **Version drift**: keep `@frontmcp/*` packages aligned.
