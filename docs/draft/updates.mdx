    **Breaking changes**

    🚨 **Node 22+ runtime floor** – FrontMCP packages now declare `engines.node >= 22`, so older Node 20 deployments must upgrade before installing the latest release.

    **Features**

    🎨 **Platform-aware UI library** – Build HTML-only consent, troubleshooting, and widget-rich flows with the new `@frontmcp/ui` package, complete with Tailwind v4 theming, HTMX hooks, and script caching for blocked-network platforms like Claude Artifacts.

    🛰️ **Prompt & resource discovery** – Servers now answer `prompts/list`, `prompts/get`, `resources/list`, and `resources/templates/list` with owner-aware names and `list_changed` notifications, so clients can build live pickers without guessing metadata.

    🚀 **CodeCall meta-API plugin** – Collapse sprawling tool lists into the new CodeCall plugin: models search, describe, and execute tools through AgentScript plans that run inside Enclave with ast-guard validation.

    🧠 **VectoriaDB semantic search** – Index every tool with the built-in vector database (with TF-IDF fallback), filter by metadata, and answer natural-language queries entirely on your own infrastructure.

    🛡️ **AST Guard security toolkit** – Validate user-provided JavaScript with the new AST validator, mix in presets or custom rules, and block risky scripts before they reach a tool; new identifier, call-target, and sidecar rules ship out of the box.

    🧾 **CRM toolset upgrade** – The demo CRM app now includes dedicated user/activity tools wired through CodeCall plus an in-memory store with login stats, showing how to orchestrate CRUD flows and telemetry from a single meta-entry point.

    🗒️ **Demo showcase notes app** – `apps/demo-showcase` bundles a full notes server with tools, resources, prompts, and OpenAPI wiring so you can see MCP discovery, tool orchestration, and auth-friendly server wiring in one place.

    🧮 **Expense prompts & resources** – The expense demo now ships categorize/report prompts plus `expense://` resources, giving you copy-ready examples of both class and function styles.

    **Testing**

    🧪 **`@frontmcp/testing` preview** – New Jest preset, fixtures, HTTP mocking, interceptors, and rich matchers (`toContainTool`, `toHaveMimeType`, `toBeError`, etc.) make it trivial to spin up a server, issue MCP calls, and assert on structured results.

    🔬 **Demo showcase e2e suites** – Tools, resources, prompts, and OpenAPI suites under `apps/demo-showcase/e2e` demonstrate the testing library in action, complete with per-suite ports, `httpMock` usage, and deterministic datastore resets.

    **Fixes**

    🧰 **CodeCall validation** – Search and describe meta-tools now require intention-rich descriptions and stricter metadata checks, which keeps models from issuing ambiguous orchestration requests.

    🔐 **Identifier whitelists** – UnknownGlobalRule, ReservedPrefixRule, and static call-target validation stop AgentScript plans from inventing globals or mutating safe call sites.

    **Docs**

    🎨 **Platform-aware UI guide** – Documented `@frontmcp/ui` theming, HTMX, and script caching workflows at `/docs/guides/ui-library`, so you can style consent and troubleshooting screens without a SPA.

    🛰️ **Discovery reference** – Added `/docs/servers/discovery` to explain `prompts/list`, `prompts/get`, and `resources/templates/list` responses plus the new `list_changed` notifications.

    📚 **Vector intelligence guide** – The VectoriaDB walkthrough now covers offline embeddings, persistence strategies, and HNSW tuning alongside updated installation, quickstart, and local-dev prerequisites.

    🧩 **Script hardening playbook** – The AST Guard and Enclave guides document the new presets, call-target validation, and CodeCall integration so teams can let copilots script without sacrificing safety.

    🗂️ **CRM & CodeCall example** – `/docs/guides/codecall-crm-demo` now covers the in-memory store, tool catalog, and CodeCall search defaults so you can replicate multi-tool orchestration in your own servers.

    📝 **Demo showcase notes guide** – New `/docs/guides/demo-showcase-notes` breaks down the notes app, datastore, prompts, resources, and Jest suites so you can reuse the patterns in your own repos.

    **Performance**

    ⚡ **Node 24 optimized runtime** – FrontMCP dev tooling, plugins, and test suites now run on Node 24 (Active LTS), giving you faster installs while keeping Node 22 support for production.

    **Build/CI**

    🔧 **Typed init defaults** – `frontmcp init` now installs `@types/node@^22` automatically, keeping editor IntelliSense aligned with the Node 22 runtime floor.

    🛠️ **Pinned Nx SHAs** – CI builds pin Nx SHAs in push workflows for reproducible caching and predictable checks across forks.
