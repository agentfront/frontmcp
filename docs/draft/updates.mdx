    **Features**
    🚀 **Platform-aware build modes** – Choose static, dynamic, or hybrid builds per tool while FrontMCP handles OpenAI subscriptions, Claude placeholders, and cached shells for you.
    🧩 **Claude Artifact widgets** – Deliver interactive widgets inside Claude Artifacts with dual-payload responses, automatic placeholder injection, and clearer error states.
    🔐 **TypeFetcher allowlists** – Lock remote typings to trusted packages or glob patterns to keep automated schema ingestion safe by default.

    **Fixes**
    🛡️ **Safer script serialization** – Widget payloads escape `</script>` markers and sanitize component names to prevent injection attacks.
    🧼 **MDX runtime stability** – The bundler now ships the MDX compiler/runtime and better error handling, reducing hydration failures and noisy warnings.

    **Docs**
    📚 **Build modes guide** – New advanced UI guide walks through static, dynamic, and hybrid data injection plus helper APIs, with links from the platform matrix.
    🗺️ **Platform + theme cleanup** – Removed deprecated ngrok references and clarified how each platform treats dynamic data, Claude placeholders, and script loading.

    **Build/CI**
    ⚡ **Vercel Build Output pipeline** – `frontmcp build --adapter vercel` creates `.vercel/output`, infers your package manager for install/build commands, and deploys cleanly via `vercel deploy --prebuilt` without an `/api` folder.
