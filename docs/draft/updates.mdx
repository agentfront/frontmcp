    ### Features
    - 🚀 **Session resurrection** – Streamable HTTP sessions now persist their state so restarts, scale-outs, and reconnects keep the same stream open.
    - 🛡️ **Hardened session stores** – Redis and Vercel KV caches can now sign payloads, cap lifetimes, and flag fingerprint mismatches so you can trust persisted sessions.
    - 🎨 **Safer UI bundling** – `@frontmcp/uipack` lazily loads esbuild, surfaces clearer install errors, and strips absolute paths so your dashboard builds stay readable.
    - 🧭 **Dashboard plugin** – Bring up the CDN-powered UI to inspect your topology, list every tool/resource, and watch MCP events in real time.
    ### Fixes
    - 🛠️ **Legacy SSE reconnections** – Legacy `/message?sessionId=…` flows work again and recreateable transports now stash initialization state until the MCP SDK finishes booting, so cold starts stay resilient.
    ### Build/CI
    - ⚡ **Unified coverage pipeline** – Run `test:unit`/`test:e2e`, their `:coverage` variants, `coverage:merge`, `coverage:all`, and `coverage:check` to produce merged coverage reports and enforce thresholds in CI.
