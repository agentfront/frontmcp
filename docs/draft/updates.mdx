    **Breaking changes**

    🚨 **Transport config refactor** – Move every session, SSE, and persistence toggle into the new top-level `transport` block; update configs now so v1.0 ships without migration warnings.

    **Features**

    🚀 **Serverless-ready scaffolding** – `frontmcp create --target <platform>` now emits Vercel, Lambda, and Cloudflare wrappers plus config files, so a single command gets you from repo to deployable artifact.

    🧠 **Context-scoped providers** – Access `FrontMcpContext` from CONTEXT-scoped providers to read request IDs, tracing info, client metadata, and auth state inside every tool, resource, and hook.

    🧪 **apps/e2e workspace** – Spin up `pnpm nx serve demo-e2e-cache`, `demo-e2e-codecall`, `demo-e2e-hooks`, `demo-e2e-errors`, or `demo-e2e-multiapp` to demo caching, CodeCall orchestration, lifecycle hooks, multi-app routing, and auth flows with matching Jest suites.

    🎨 **Universal renderer upgrade** – Tool UIs now emit dual-payload output with resilient platform detection, so Claude Artifacts, Cursor, and in-browser previews all render consistently without guesswork.

    **Fixes**

    🛡️ **Session hardening** – Transport recreation now validates session IDs, sanitizes inputs, and drops corrupted Redis payloads before they are reused.

    🧩 **Peer dependency alignment** – `zod`, `react`, and `react-dom` ship as peer dependencies across packages, preventing duplicate installs and version drift in large workspaces.

    🔐 **UI security polish** – Markdown and templated UI rendering gained stricter escaping, URL validation, and CSP defaults to block XSS regressions in custom layouts.

    **Docs**

    📚 **Server transport guide** – The server reference documents the new `transport`/`redis` blocks plus migration tables so you can retire `auth.transport` before it breaks.

    🧾 **Request context + providers** – The extensibility guide walks through CONTEXT-scoped providers, `FrontMcpContext.fetch()`, and tracing helpers so observability data flows into every tool.

    🧑‍🏫 **apps/e2e playbooks** – The testing, caching, and CodeCall guides now point at the new `apps/e2e/**` workspace, complete with Nx serve commands, e2e specs, and walkthroughs for cache stats, CodeCall plans, and prompt-driven reports.

    **Build/CI**

    🔧 **Docker + release pipeline** – Projects scaffold Docker assets, Redis scripts, and Verdaccio-friendly publish loops, while e2e workflows gained retry logic, Nx run-many batching, `--forceExit`, and a dedicated UI debug workflow.
