    🚀 **Node 24 optimized runtime** – Build against the Active LTS release with FrontMCP validated on Node 24 while keeping Node 22 as the supported floor.

    🧠 **VectoriaDB semantic search** – Index every tool with the new first-party vector database, apply metadata filters, and serve natural-language discovery entirely offline.

    🛡️ **Stronger editor typings** – `frontmcp init` now installs `@types/node@^22`, so your IDE matches the runtime APIs without manual tweaks.

    📚 **Updated onboarding guides** – Installation, quickstart, local dev, and the new VectoriaDB guide now spell out the runtime expectations and how to wire up semantic search so teams can upgrade confidently.
