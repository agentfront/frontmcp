    ## Features

    🚀 **Live operations console** – Visualize your server graph, traffic, logs, and metrics in a single SSE-powered dashboard so you can spot issues without juggling tabs.

    🧠 **Memory management toolbox** – Remember, recall, forget, and list scoped memories with TTL-aware helpers so agents keep context without hand-holding state.

    🛡️ **Claude-style approvals** – Gate sensitive tools with PKCE webhooks, auditable grants, and scopes that keep dangerous operations locked behind approvals.

    📡 **Progress feedback** – Agents and tools now emit lifecycle updates whenever clients include a `_meta.progressToken`, keeping end users informed about long-running work.

    ## Docs
