    ## Features

    🚀 **Session resurrection** – Streamable HTTP sessions now persist state and reattach to the same stream using the recreateable transports so serverless nodes, restarts, and reconnects stay live.

    🛡️ **Hardened session stores** – Redis and Vercel KV session caches can now sign data, cap lifetime, rate-limit lookups, and optionally reject fingerprint mismatches to block tampering and enumeration.

    🎨 **Safer UI bundling** – The @frontmcp/uipack builder lazy-loads esbuild, surfaces a clear install error if it is missing, and strips absolute paths from bundle failures so your logs stay readable.

    🧩 **Lean DI exports** – Provider metadata, records, and DI helpers are re-exported as type-only exports through `@frontmcp/sdk`, so your bundles stay lean while existing DI imports keep working.

    ## Docs

    📚 **Providers compatibility guide** – The Providers doc now explains how DI metadata and record helpers stay available via type-only exports so migrating from older `@frontmcp/di` imports feels seamless.
