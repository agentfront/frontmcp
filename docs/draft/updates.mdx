    **Breaking changes**

    🚨 **Node 22+ runtime floor** – FrontMCP packages now declare `engines.node >= 22`, so older Node 20 deployments must upgrade before installing the latest release.

    **Features**

    🧠 **VectoriaDB semantic search** – Index every tool with the built-in vector database, filter by metadata, and answer natural-language queries entirely on your own infrastructure.

    🛡️ **AST Guard security toolkit** – Validate user-provided JavaScript with the new AST validator, mix in presets or custom rules, and block risky scripts before they reach a tool.

    **Build/CI**

    🔧 **Typed init defaults** – `frontmcp init` now installs `@types/node@^22` automatically, keeping editor IntelliSense in lockstep with the runtime APIs.

    **Docs**

    📚 **Vector intelligence guide** – New VectoriaDB walkthrough plus refreshed installation, quickstart, and local-dev pages clarify runtime expectations and persistence strategies.

    🧩 **Script hardening playbook** – The AST Guard guide shows how to wire policy enforcement into hooks so teams can let copilots write scripts without sacrificing safety.

    **Performance**

    ⚡ **Node 24 optimized runtime** – FrontMCP dev tooling and test suites now run on Node 24 (Active LTS), giving you faster installs while keeping Node 22 support for production.
