    **Breaking changes**

    🚨 **Node 22+ runtime floor** - FrontMCP packages now declare `engines.node >= 22`, so older Node 20 deployments must upgrade before installing the latest release.

    **Features**

    🚀 **CodeCall meta-API plugin** - Collapse sprawling tool lists into searchable meta-tools, now with TF-IDF or Vectoria embeddings, VM presets, sidecar references, and an optional direct invoke mode so models can script complex workflows safely.

    🎨 **Platform-aware UI kit** - Ship HTMX-ready consent pages with the new `@frontmcp/ui` library; choose Tailwind themes, cache scripts for Claude Artifacts, and reuse HTML snippets across MCP resources.

    🧭 **Resource endpoints** - Decorate read-only data with `@Resource` and `@ResourceTemplate`, attach metadata, and deliver URI templates so models can pull configuration, documents, or API snapshots without side effects.

    🧠 **Vector discovery stack** - VectoriaDB and the new TF-IDF fallback index every tool locally, add HNSW acceleration, and expose storage adapters so semantic search works both online and offline.

    🛡️ **AST Guard security toolkit** - Harden AgentScript execution with new identifier whitelists, sidecar limits, and preset refinements that block Unicode attacks, call-target assignment, and rogue globals.

    🧾 **CRM toolset upgrade** - The demo CRM app now includes CrmStore, dedicated user and activity tools, and CodeCall wiring so you can study multi-step orchestration with logging and stats.

    **Fixes**

    🧰 **CodeCall validation** - Search and describe meta-tools now require intention-rich descriptions and stricter metadata checks, which keeps models from issuing ambiguous orchestration requests.

    🔐 **Identifier whitelists** - UnknownGlobalRule, ReservedPrefixRule, and static call-target validation stop AgentScript plans from inventing globals or mutating safe call sites.

    **Docs**

    📚 **Vector intelligence guide** - The VectoriaDB walkthrough now covers TF-IDF, persistence strategies, and HNSW tuning alongside updated installation, quickstart, and local-dev prerequisites.

    🖼️ **UI builder guide** - New documentation shows how to compose layouts, HTMX actions, and CDN-safe theming with `@frontmcp/ui`.

    🧩 **Script hardening playbook** - The AST Guard and Enclave guides document the new presets, call-target validation, and CodeCall integration so teams can let copilots script without sacrificing safety.

    🗂️ **CRM and CodeCall example** - A dedicated CrmMcpApp guide walks through the CodeCall search workflow, sample AgentScript plans, and Nx commands for running the demo.

    **Performance**

    ⚡ **Node 24 optimized runtime** - FrontMCP dev tooling, plugins, and test suites now run on Node 24 (Active LTS), giving you faster installs while keeping Node 22 support for production.

    **Build/CI**

    🔧 **Typed init defaults** - `frontmcp init` now installs `@types/node@^22` automatically, keeping editor IntelliSense in lockstep with the runtime APIs.

    🛠️ **Pinned Nx SHAs** - CI builds pin Nx SHAs in push workflows for reproducible caching and predictable checks across forks.
