    **Features**

    🚀 **Remote orchestration gateway** – Connect other MCP servers through resilient proxies, circuit breakers, and namespaces so tools, resources, and prompts participate in unified flows.

    🧠 **Memory management tooling** – The Remember Plugin now ships with list/forget helpers, scope-aware limits, and dashboard-ready observability so session memory never drifts.

    🧩 **Storage helper library** – `@frontmcp/utils` now auto-detects Upstash/Vercel/Redis/memory backends, validates TTLs/patterns, and plugs directly into approvals and cache workflows.

    🧪 **Agent e2e suite** – `demo-e2e-agents` exercises calculator, echo, and orchestrator agents with mocked adapters so CI can verify agent tooling without network calls.

    **Build/CI**

    ⚙️ **Coverage & testing scripts** – New Nx targets and coverage commands run unit/e2e suites, merge stats, and enforce coverage checks so aggregated results stay trustworthy.

    **Docs**

    📚 **Fresh guides** – Added coverage for remote orchestration, memory management helpers, storage utilities, the dashboard plugin, and the agent-focused e2e suite so users discover the new capabilities.
