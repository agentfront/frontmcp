    **Breaking changes**

    🚨 **Node 22+ runtime floor** – FrontMCP packages now declare `engines.node >= 22`, so older Node 20 deployments must upgrade before installing the latest release.

    **Features**

    🎨 **Platform-aware UI library** – Build HTML-only consent, troubleshooting, and widget-rich flows with the new `@frontmcp/ui` package, complete with Tailwind v4 theming, HTMX hooks, and script caching for blocked-network platforms like Claude Artifacts.

    📡 **Transport-aware auth** – Flip the new `auth.transport` switches per app to enable streamable, stateful, or stateless HTTP plus SSE listeners, so production stays locked down while demos and CI can bypass the `initialize` handshake.

    🔐 **Authentication reference servers** – Boot `pnpm nx serve demo-public`, `demo-orchestrated-auth`, or `demo-transparent-auth` to see each mode with consent flows, anonymous scopes, and transport presets before wiring your own app.

    🛰️ **Prompt & resource discovery** – Servers now answer `prompts/list`, `prompts/get`, `resources/list`, and `resources/templates/list` with owner-aware names and `list_changed` notifications, so clients can build live pickers without guessing metadata.

    🚀 **CodeCall meta-API plugin** – Collapse sprawling tool lists into the new CodeCall plugin: models search, describe, and execute tools through AgentScript plans that run inside Enclave with ast-guard validation.

    🧠 **VectoriaDB semantic search** – Index every tool with the built-in vector database (with TF-IDF fallback), filter by metadata, and answer natural-language queries entirely on your own infrastructure.

    🛡️ **AST Guard security toolkit** – Validate user-provided JavaScript with the new AST validator, mix in presets or custom rules, and block risky scripts before they reach a tool; new identifier, call-target, computed-destructuring, and sidecar rules ship out of the box.

    🧱 **Computed destructuring guard** – AgentScript now blocks computed property names in destructuring so attackers can't reassemble `constructor`, `prototype`, or `__proto__` to reach Function constructors.

    🧾 **CRM toolset upgrade** – The demo CRM app now includes dedicated user/activity tools wired through CodeCall plus an in-memory store with login stats, showing how to orchestrate CRUD flows and telemetry from a single meta-entry point.

    🧪 **@frontmcp/testing** – Author Jest-based end-to-end suites with fixture injection, HTTP mocking, request interceptors, and custom MCP matchers while the runner boots your server automatically via `test.use()`.

    🗃️ **Demo Showcase server** – Boot the new `apps/demo-showcase` notes app to exercise tools, resources, prompts, and OpenAPI adapters in one place, complete with sample `apps/demo-showcase/e2e` suites you can copy into your own repo.

    🧰 **Layer 0 pre-scanner** – AgentScript now runs through a pre-parser `ast-guard` scan that blocks ReDoS payloads, Trojan Source characters, deep nesting, and oversize inputs before the AST is even built.

    🧠 **AI Scoring Gate** – Chain the fast heuristics with the new progressive escalation path so benign scripts clear in ~1ms while suspicious plans re-run through local LLM or external scorers before Enclave executes them.

    🧬 **On-device scoring** – The `local-llm` backend downloads transformers.js models once, caches them on disk, and optionally pairs with VectoriaDB similarity mode so sensitive scripts never leave your VPC.

    🧵 **Worker Pool adapter** – Opt into the new worker-pool runtime to execute CodeCall plans inside OS-isolated threads with queue backpressure, strict memory caps, and graceful restarts.

    🛑 **I/O flood protection** – Console output and call counts are now rate limited per script, preventing log floods and transport stalls even when models misbehave.

    **Fixes**

    🧰 **CodeCall validation** – Search and describe meta-tools now require intention-rich descriptions and stricter metadata checks, which keeps models from issuing ambiguous orchestration requests.

    🔐 **Identifier whitelists** – UnknownGlobalRule, ReservedPrefixRule, and static call-target validation stop AgentScript plans from inventing globals or mutating safe call sites.

    **Docs**

    🧪 **Testing suite docs** – Added `/docs/testing/overview`, fixtures, matchers, interceptors, HTTP mocking, and authentication pages plus Demo Showcase references so teams can ship copy-pasteable regression suites.

    🎨 **Platform-aware UI guide** – Documented `@frontmcp/ui` theming, HTMX, and script caching workflows at `/docs/guides/ui-library`, so you can style consent and troubleshooting screens without a SPA.

    🛰️ **Discovery reference** – Added `/docs/servers/discovery` to explain `prompts/list`, `prompts/get`, and `resources/templates/list` responses plus the new `list_changed` notifications.

    📚 **Vector intelligence guide** – The VectoriaDB walkthrough now covers offline embeddings, persistence strategies, and HNSW tuning alongside updated installation, quickstart, and local-dev prerequisites.

    🧩 **Script hardening playbook** – The AST Guard and Enclave guides document the new presets, call-target validation, and CodeCall integration so teams can let copilots script without sacrificing safety.

    🗂️ **CRM & CodeCall example** – `/docs/guides/codecall-crm-demo` now covers the in-memory store, tool catalog, and CodeCall search defaults so you can replicate multi-tool orchestration in your own servers.

    🔑 **Auth demo guide** – New `/docs/authentication/demo-servers` walks through each Nx sample, required environment variables, and how to pair them with `@frontmcp/testing`.

    🧠 **Enclave scoring guide** – Expanded `/docs/guides/enclave` with local-LLM and progressive configuration recipes plus cache tips for Hugging Face models so teams can enable semantic reviews entirely on-premises.

    🛡️ **AST Guard updates** – `/docs/guides/ast-guard` now spells out the NoComputedDestructuring rule with attack walkthroughs so you can explain the new protections to security reviewers.

    🌐 **Transport controls reference** – `/docs/servers/server` now documents the `auth.transport` toggles so you know exactly when to enable streamable, stateful, or stateless HTTP and SSE listeners.

    **Performance**

    ⚡ **Node 24 optimized runtime** – FrontMCP dev tooling, plugins, and test suites now run on Node 24 (Active LTS), giving you faster installs while keeping Node 22 support for production.

    **Build/CI**

    🔧 **Typed init defaults** – `frontmcp init` now installs `@types/node@^24` automatically, keeping editor IntelliSense in lockstep with the runtime APIs.

    🛠️ **Pinned Nx SHAs** – CI builds pin Nx SHAs in push workflows for reproducible caching and predictable checks across forks.
