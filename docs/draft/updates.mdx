    ## Features

    🚀 **Agent orchestration upgrades** – Agents now act as first-class tools with advanced hooks, scoped visibility, and orchestrator demos so multi-agent flows stay deterministic and debuggable.

    🧩 **Dashboard plugin** – Add the new Dashboard app/plugin to stream your server graph via SSE, list tools/resources, and protect the CDN UI with optional token auth.

    🧰 **Shared utils library** – `@frontmcp/utils` centralizes naming, URI, path, content, HTTP, fs, escaping, serialization, and crypto helpers so apps and plugins share one trusted toolkit.

    🛡️ **Scoped plugin control** – Register plugins with app or server scope (with standalone checks) so hooks and providers run only where you expect them, keeping cross-app behavior predictable.

    ## Build/CI

    🧪 **Coverage automation** – Nx scripts `test:unit:coverage`, `test:e2e:coverage`, `coverage:merge`, `coverage:all`, and `coverage:check` merge unit and E2E reports and make `nyc` thresholds part of CI gating.
