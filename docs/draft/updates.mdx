    **Features**
    🎯 **Transport recreation lab** – Validate session continuity and counter persistence with the new `demo-e2e-transport-recreation` server, which exposes tools to inspect session IDs and hit counters before and after serverless cold starts.

    🛡️ **Serverless transport resilience** – Recreateable streamable transports now queue pending initialization state, replay it before the first request, and fail fast when MCP internals diverge so reconnecting clients stay synchronized.

    **Build/CI**
    ⚡ **Unified coverage reports** – Nx scripts collect coverage for unit and E2E targets (`test:unit:coverage` and `test:e2e:coverage`), combine them (`coverage:merge` / `coverage:all`), and guard quality with `coverage:check` so you ship a single consolidated report.

    🧪 **CLI coverage toggle** – Append `--coverage` to `npx frontmcp test` whenever you need targeted metrics; the CLI prints a confirmation and drops artifacts under `coverage/` for merging.

    **Docs**
    📚 **Coverage workflows documented** – The testing guides now explain the Nx coverage scripts, CLI coverage flag, and the transport recreation lab so teams can reproduce the results locally.
