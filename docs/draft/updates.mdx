    **Breaking changes**

    🚨 **Node 22+ runtime floor** – FrontMCP packages now declare `engines.node >= 22`, so older Node 20 deployments must upgrade before installing the latest release.

    **Features**

    🚀 **CodeCall meta-API plugin** – Collapse sprawling tool lists into the new CodeCall plugin: models search, describe, and execute tools through AgentScript plans that run inside Enclave with ast-guard validation.

    🧠 **VectoriaDB semantic search** – Index every tool with the built-in vector database (with TF-IDF fallback), filter by metadata, and answer natural-language queries entirely on your own infrastructure.

    🛡️ **AST Guard security toolkit** – Validate user-provided JavaScript with the new AST validator, mix in presets or custom rules, and block risky scripts before they reach a tool; new identifier, call-target, and sidecar rules ship out of the box.

    🧾 **CRM toolset upgrade** – The demo CRM app now includes dedicated user/activity tools wired through CodeCall, showing how to orchestrate CRUD flows plus activity logging from a single meta-entry point.

    **Fixes**

    🧰 **CodeCall validation** – Search and describe meta-tools now require intention-rich descriptions and stricter metadata checks, which keeps models from issuing ambiguous orchestration requests.

    🔐 **Identifier whitelists** – UnknownGlobalRule, ReservedPrefixRule, and static call-target validation stop AgentScript plans from inventing globals or mutating safe call sites.

    **Docs**

    📚 **Vector intelligence guide** – The VectoriaDB walkthrough now covers offline embeddings, persistence strategies, and HNSW tuning alongside updated installation, quickstart, and local-dev prerequisites.

    🧩 **Script hardening playbook** – The AST Guard and Enclave guides document the new presets, call-target validation, and CodeCall integration so teams can let copilots script without sacrificing safety.

    🗂️ **CRM & CodeCall example** – The apps reference now includes the CRM CodeCall sample so you can replicate multi-tool orchestration in your own servers.

    **Performance**

    ⚡ **Node 24 optimized runtime** – FrontMCP dev tooling, plugins, and test suites now run on Node 24 (Active LTS), giving you faster installs while keeping Node 22 support for production.

    **Build/CI**

    🔧 **Typed init defaults** – `frontmcp init` now installs `@types/node@^22` automatically, keeping editor IntelliSense in lockstep with the runtime APIs.

    🛠️ **Pinned Nx SHAs** – CI builds pin Nx SHAs in push workflows for reproducible caching and predictable checks across forks.
