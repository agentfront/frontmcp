## Overview

The Dashboard plugin adds a streaming observability surface that draws the full MCP graph, exposes live metrics for tools, resources, prompts, and scopes, and ships with a CDN-backed UI. It keeps pace with registrations, agent activity, and authorization changes so you can inspect your server without pausing execution.

<Info>
  The Dashboard plugin ships in `@frontmcp/plugins`. `DashboardApp` is the recommended integration for development, while `DashboardPlugin` lets you mount the UI behind your own routes and authentication.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the DashboardApp">
    The easiest way to get started is to add `DashboardApp` to your server. It automatically exposes `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/sse`, and message endpoints:
    ```ts
    import { FrontMcp } from '@frontmcp/sdk';
    import { DashboardApp } from '@frontmcp/plugins';

    @FrontMcp({
      info: { name: 'Observability Server', version: '0.1.0' },
      apps: [DashboardApp],
    })
    export default class ObservabilityServer {}
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use DashboardPlugin for advanced control">
    Mount the plugin if you need to customize the route prefix, authentication, or CDN assets:
    ```ts
    import { DashboardPlugin } from '@frontmcp/plugins';

    new DashboardPlugin({
      enabled: true,
      basePath: '/dashboard',
      auth: {
        enabled: true,
        token: process.env.DASHBOARD_TOKEN,
      },
    });
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Open `/dashboard`">
    Visit `/dashboard` in your browser. If `auth.token` is configured, append `?token=<secret>` when prompted. The UI keeps streaming via `/dashboard/sse` and calls `dashboard:graph` for metadata.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuration

| Option           | Type      | Default                    | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | --------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`        | `boolean` | `auto`                     | Automatically enabled in dev mode or when `DashboardApp` is registered. Set to `false` to hide the dashboard. |
| `basePath`       | `string`  | `/dashboard`               | Base path for the HTML, SSE, and MCP endpoints.                                                               |
| `auth.enabled`   | `boolean` | `false`                    | Require a token when opening `/dashboard`.                                                                    |
| `auth.token`     | `string`  | -                          | Secret token that clients must provide as `?token=`.                                                          |
| `cdn.entrypoint` | `string`  | -                          | Override the dashboard UI bundle URL when you host your own assets.                                           |
| `cdn.react`      | `string`  | `https://esm.sh/react`     | CDN host for React.                                                                                           |
| `cdn.xyflow`     | `string`  | `https://esm.sh/reactflow` | CDN host for React Flow (graph rendering).                                                                    |

<Note>Enable `auth` whenever the dashboard is accessible from the public internet. Without authentication the graph exposes tool names and scopes to anyone who can reach the endpoint.</Note>

## Architecture

DashboardApp runs as a standalone app inside your server scope and streams updates to the browser via Server-Sent Events (`/dashboard/sse`). The UI calls the MCP tool `dashboard:graph` to fetch nodes, edges, and metadata, then renders an interactive diagram with React Flow. Tool count cards, resource lists, and prompt summaries refresh as SSE events signal new registrations.

### Tools

#### `dashboard:graph`

Fetches the topology for tools, resources, prompts, and scopes.

- `includeSchemas?: boolean` – include JSON schemas for every tool/resource.
- `refresh?: boolean` – force a refresh even if the server is idle.

**Output:** `{ nodes: GraphNode[]; edges: GraphEdge[]; metadata: GraphMetadata }`

```ts
const graph = await mcp.tools.call('dashboard:graph', {
  includeSchemas: true,
});
console.log(graph.nodes.length, graph.edges.length);
```

#### `dashboard:list-tools`

Enumerates the tools the dashboard is tracking.

- `filter?: string` – regex-style filter for tool names.
- `includeSchemas?: boolean` – include schema details.
- returns `ToolMetadata[]` with descriptions, metadata, and MCP hook info.

#### `dashboard:list-resources`

Lists static resources and templates.

- `filter?: string` – match URI or template patterns.
- `includeTemplates?: boolean` – toggle template metadata.
- returns resource rows with MIME types, handlers, and scope owners.

## Security

By default the dashboard is open inside the process, so prefer mounting it behind `DashboardPlugin` with `auth.enabled` and a long-lived token. The UI accepts the token at `/dashboard?token=<value>` and the server rejects SSE connections without it.

## CDN Customization

You can host the dashboard UI yourself by specifying `cdn.entrypoint`. Replace the default CDN and tweak `cdn.react`/`cdn.xyflow` when you need a locked-down environment or want to pin exact versions. Combine this with `auth.token` and `enabled: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'` to keep observability in development.

<Tip>
  The dashboard UI is a self-contained HTML payload that only depends on React and React Flow from CDN, so you can mirror it behind a CDN or local asset proxy without changing the plugin.
