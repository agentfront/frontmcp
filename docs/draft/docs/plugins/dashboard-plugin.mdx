The Dashboard plugin adds a ready-to-use visual surface that renders your server graph, lists your tools/resources, and streams updates in real time via SSE.

## Why add the dashboard

Use the dashboard to diagnose registrations, watch in-flight executions, and prove compliance.

  <Card title="Graph visualization" icon="diagram-project">
    Get nodes, edges, and status data for every app, tool, resource, and prompt so you can spot drift or bottlenecks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tool explorer" icon="tool">
    Built-in tools like `dashboard:list-tools` and `dashboard:list-resources` surface metadata, descriptions, and schema coverage for debugging.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-time updates" icon="signal">
    The UI uses SSE streams to show live state without manual refreshes, so approvals, memory entries, and transports stay visible.
  </Card>

## Installation & configuration

```ts
import { DashboardPlugin } from '@frontmcp/plugins';

@FrontMcp({
  plugins: [
    new DashboardPlugin({
      basePath: '/dashboard',
      auth: { enabled: true, token: process.env.DASHBOARD_TOKEN },
    }),
  ],
})
export default class Server {}
```

The plugin loads its UI bundle from the CDN by default and mounts it at the configured `basePath`. Add `auth.token` to protect access or let it remain public in development.

## Graph + introspection tools

Dashboard tools are exposed alongside your own tools. `dashboard:graph` returns nodes/edges, `dashboard:list-tools` enumerates each registered tool, and `dashboard:list-resources` mirrors the resource catalog. You can call them programmatically or run them from the UI to understand how memory, agents, and approvals move through the system.

## Real-time insights

The dashboard keeps a live SSE connection to your MCP server, so tool registrations, memory updates, and transport health appear immediately. The UI also surfaces console logs and alerts when a remote app reconnects.

<Tip>
  Protect the dashboard in production by setting `auth.enabled` to `true`, passing a strong `auth.token`, and ensuring the reverse proxy routes the same `basePath`.
