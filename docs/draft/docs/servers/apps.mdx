Apps are how you **group capabilities** in FrontMCP. Each app can contribute **tools**, **resources**, **prompts**, plus **providers**, **adapters**, and **plugins**.

## Minimal app

```ts
import { App } from '@frontmcp/sdk';

@App({
  id: 'hello',
  name: 'Hello App',
  tools: [],
})
export default class HelloApp {}
```

Add it to your server:

```ts
@FrontMcp({ info: { name: 'Demo', version: '0.1.0' }, apps: [HelloApp] })
export default class Server {}
```

## App options

```ts
@App({
  id?: string,
  name: string,
  description?: string,
  providers?: ProviderType[],
  authProviders?: AuthProviderType[],
  plugins?: PluginType[],
  adapters?: AdapterType[],
  tools?: ToolType[],
  resources?: ResourceType[],
  prompts?: PromptType[],
  auth?: AuthOptions,                 // app‑default auth (overrides server auth)
  standalone?: 'includeInParent' | boolean, // isolate scope / expose separately
})
```

**Scoping & auth**

- If the server uses **`splitByApp: true`**, each app is isolated and **must** configure its own auth (server-level `auth` is disallowed).
- `standalone: true` makes the app expose its own scope/entry; `'includeInParent'` lists it under the parent while keeping isolation.

**Dependency resolution**

- Providers resolve **tool → app → server**.
- Plugins/adapters attach at app scope; generated items inherit the app’s policies and provenance.

## Example: app with adapter + providers

```ts
@App({
  id: 'billing',
  name: 'Billing',
  providers: [DbProvider, CacheProvider],
  adapters: [
    // e.g. OpenAPI adapter that generates tools/resources from a spec
    BillingOpenApiAdapter,
  ],
})
export default class BillingApp {}
```

## Remote Apps (Roadmap)

<Info>
  **Coming soon:** Connect to remote MCP servers and register them as `@App({ remote: true })`.
  This will allow you to encapsulate external MCP servers and forward traffic with authentication,
  treating them as first-class apps in your FrontMCP server.
