      CodeCall solves the tool explosion problem that's costing you tokens, slowing your agents, and forcing you to
      build REST endpoints you shouldn't need. Open source, self-hosted, works with any LLM—not just Claude.

    >
      Why most OpenAPI-to-MCP tools are leaking your credentials, mixing headers between requests, and routing your customer
      tokens through someone else's cloud—and how FrontMCP fixes it with authentication never exposed to clients, request
      isolation guarantees, and security validation out of the box.

      Most SDK examples wire one transport to one client. That collapses when many IDEs, bots, and dashboards need to share
      one server. FrontMCP flips the default: sessions, transport identity, per‑app scoping, auth, DI, and decorators—so a
      single server can safely serve many agents across multiple apps.

        The TypeScript-first framework for building production-grade MCP servers with decorators, DI, and
        Streamable HTTP. If you’ve tried wiring up the Model Context Protocol (MCP) by hand, you already know the drill
        or define JSON schemas manually,...
