Plugins are powerful components that add cross-cutting functionality to your MCP servers. Instead of implementing features like caching, authentication, or observability in every tool, plugins provide reusable capabilities that work across all your tools and apps.

## Why Use Plugins?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Zero Duplication" icon="clone">
    Add capabilities like caching or code execution once and apply them to all tools automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Composable" icon="cubes">
    Mix and match plugins to build exactly the features you need without coupling.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cross-App" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left">
    Plugins work across all apps in your server, providing consistent behavior everywhere.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Production-Ready" icon="rocket">
    Battle-tested implementations for common needs like caching, rate limiting, and monitoring.
  </Card>

## Official Plugins

These plugins are maintained by the FrontMCP team and included in `@frontmcp/plugins`.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Remember Plugin" icon="brain" href="/docs/plugins/remember-plugin">
    Encrypted session memory with scoped storage and tool approval system for secure AI agent interactions.

    **Features:**
    - Encrypted AES-256-GCM storage with HKDF-SHA256 scope-based key derivation and unique IV per entry
    - Multiple scopes: session, user, tool, global
    - Tool approval system with audit trails
    - Multiple backends: Memory, Redis, Vercel KV, Upstash
    - Branded payloads for semantic categorization

    **Best for:** Session memory, user preferences, tool permissions, conversation context

  </Card>

  <Card title="CodeCall Plugin" icon="code" href="/docs/plugins/codecall/overview">
    Hide large toolsets behind a code-first meta-API. Instead of exposing hundreds of tools directly, CodeCall provides
    search, describe, and execute capabilities that let models write JavaScript plans to orchestrate your tools.

    **Features:**
    - Search and discover tools dynamically
    - Generate JavaScript execution plans
    - Defense-in-depth security with [Enclave](/docs/guides/enclave) (AST validation + runtime sandboxing)
    - Multi-app tool orchestration
    - Direct invocation mode for simple cases

    **Best for:** Large toolsets, OpenAPI-generated tools, multi-app workflows, complex tool orchestration

  </Card>

  <Card title="Cache Plugin" icon="database" href="/docs/plugins/cache-plugin">
    Transparently cache tool responses to reduce redundant computation and improve response times. Works with both
    in-memory and Redis backends.

    **Features:**
    - Deterministic input-based cache keys
    - Configurable TTL per tool
    - Sliding window for hot data
    - Redis support for multi-instance deployments
    - Opt-in per-tool caching

    **Best for:** Expensive computations, API rate limiting, multi-tenant data, frequently accessed resources

  </Card>

<Note>More official plugins are coming soon! Rate limiting, observability, and validation plugins are in development.</Note>

## Community Plugins

Community plugins are created and maintained by the FrontMCP community. While not officially supported, they extend FrontMCP's capabilities with specialized features.

<Warning>
  Community plugins are not maintained by the FrontMCP team. Please review the code and security practices before using
  them in production.
</Warning>

### How to Find Community Plugins

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search npm">

    ```bash
    npm search frontmcp-plugin
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check GitHub Topics">
    Browse repositories tagged with [`frontmcp-plugin`](https://github.com/topics/frontmcp-plugin) on GitHub.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Join the Community">
    Visit the [FrontMCP Discussions](https://github.com/agentfront/frontmcp/discussions) to discover and share plugins.

## Creating Custom Plugins

You can create custom plugins to add any cross-cutting capability to FrontMCP. Plugins are TypeScript classes decorated with `@Plugin` that hook into the tool execution lifecycle.

### Basic Plugin Structure

```ts
import { Plugin, PluginContext, ToolHooks } from '@frontmcp/sdk';

@Plugin({
  name: 'my-plugin',
  description: 'My custom plugin',
})
export default class MyCustomPlugin implements ToolHooks {
  // Called before tool execution
  async beforeToolCall(ctx: PluginContext) {
    // Add pre-execution logic (validation, auth, etc.)
    console.log(`About to execute tool: ${ctx.toolName}`);
  }

  // Called after successful tool execution
  async afterToolCall(ctx: PluginContext, result: any) {
    // Add post-execution logic (logging, caching, etc.)
    console.log(`Tool ${ctx.toolName} returned:`, result);
    return result; // Can transform the result
  }

  // Called on tool execution errors
  async onToolError(ctx: PluginContext, error: Error) {
    // Add error handling logic
    console.error(`Tool ${ctx.toolName} failed:`, error);
    throw error; // Re-throw or transform the error
  }

  // Initialize with options
  static init(options?: MyPluginOptions) {
    return new MyCustomPlugin(options);
  }
}
```

### Publishing Your Plugin

When publishing a community plugin:

1. **Package Name:** Use the pattern `@yourscope/frontmcp-plugin-name` or `frontmcp-plugin-name`
2. **Keywords:** Include `frontmcp`, `frontmcp-plugin`, `mcp`, `plugin`
3. **README:** Include installation, usage, examples, and performance considerations
4. **License:** Use a permissive license (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)
5. **Tests:** Include comprehensive test coverage including hook behavior
6. **TypeScript:** Provide TypeScript types and declarations

```json package.json
{
  "name": "@yourscope/frontmcp-plugin-myfeature",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "FrontMCP plugin for MyFeature",
  "keywords": ["frontmcp", "frontmcp-plugin", "mcp", "plugin", "myfeature"],
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@frontmcp/sdk": "^0.4.0"
  }
}
```

## Plugin Comparison

| ------------ | ------------------------- | -------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| **Remember** | Session memory, approvals | Low      | Per-session  | Low         |
| **CodeCall** | Large toolsets, workflows | Low      | Cross-app    | Medium      |
| **Cache**    | Expensive operations      | Minimal  | Per-tool     | Low         |
| **Custom**   | Any cross-cutting feature | Varies   | Configurable | Medium-High |
