Apps are the **organizational units** for capabilities in FrontMCP. Each app groups related **tools**, **resources**, and **prompts** into a cohesive domain, along with **providers**, **adapters**, and **plugins** that support them.

## Why Apps?

In FrontMCP, apps provide domain boundaries and enable multi-tenant architectures:

| Aspect       | App                       | Server                 | Tool                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Purpose**  | Group capabilities        | Host apps              | Execute actions      |
| **Scope**    | Feature/domain boundary   | Process entry point    | Single operation     |
| **Contains** | Tools, resources, prompts | Apps, global providers | Input → Output logic |

Apps are ideal for:

- **Feature domains** — billing, users, analytics as separate concerns
- **Team boundaries** — each team owns their app
- **Multi-tenant** — isolate per customer with `splitByApp: true`
- **Third-party integrations** — wrap OpenAPI adapters per service

## Minimal App

```ts
import { App } from '@frontmcp/sdk';

@App({
  id: 'hello',
  name: 'Hello App',
  tools: [],
})
export default class HelloApp {}
```

Add it to your server:

```ts
@FrontMcp({ info: { name: 'Demo', version: '0.1.0' }, apps: [HelloApp] })
export default class Server {}
```

## App options

```ts
@App({
  id?: string,
  name: string,
  description?: string,
  providers?: ProviderType[],
  authProviders?: AuthProviderType[],
  plugins?: PluginType[],
  adapters?: AdapterType[],
  tools?: ToolType[],
  resources?: ResourceType[],
  prompts?: PromptType[],
  auth?: AuthOptions,                 // app‑default auth (overrides server auth)
  standalone?: 'includeInParent' | boolean, // isolate scope / expose separately
})
```

**Field descriptions:**

| Field           | Description                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`            | Unique identifier; used in URLs when `splitByApp: true` |
| `name`          | Human-readable display name                             |
| `description`   | Optional description for documentation                  |
| `providers`     | DI providers scoped to this app                         |
| `authProviders` | Authentication providers for this app                   |
| `plugins`       | Plugins attached at app scope                           |
| `adapters`      | Adapters (e.g., OpenAPI) that generate tools/resources  |
| `tools`         | Tool classes registered to this app                     |
| `resources`     | Resource classes registered to this app                 |
| `prompts`       | Prompt classes registered to this app                   |
| `auth`          | App-level auth config (overrides server auth)           |
| `standalone`    | Isolation mode: `true`, `false`, or `'includeInParent'` |

**Scoping & auth**

- If the server uses **`splitByApp: true`**, each app is isolated and **must** configure its own auth (server-level `auth` is disallowed).
- `standalone: true` makes the app expose its own scope/entry; `'includeInParent'` lists it under the parent while keeping isolation.

**Dependency resolution**

- Providers resolve **tool → app → server**.
- Plugins/adapters attach at app scope; generated items inherit the app’s policies and provenance.

## Example: app with adapter + providers

```ts
@App({
  id: 'billing',
  name: 'Billing',
  providers: [DbProvider, CacheProvider],
  adapters: [
    // e.g. OpenAPI adapter that generates tools/resources from a spec
    BillingOpenApiAdapter,
  ],
})
export default class BillingApp {}
```

## Remote Apps (Roadmap)

<Info>
  **Coming soon:** Connect to remote MCP servers and register them as `@App({ remote: true })`.
  This will allow you to encapsulate external MCP servers and forward traffic with authentication,
  treating them as first-class apps in your FrontMCP server.

## Best Practices

**Do:**

- Use descriptive `id` values that work as URL segments
- Group related tools, resources, and prompts in the same app
- Configure `standalone: true` when apps need isolated auth
- Use adapters to generate tools from OpenAPI specs

**Don't:**

- Put unrelated functionality in the same app
- Mix authentication strategies within a single app
- Create apps with only one tool (use the server directly)
