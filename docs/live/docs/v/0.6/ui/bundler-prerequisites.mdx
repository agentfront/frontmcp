description: Install esbuild and review sanitized bundler errors before you compile @frontmcp/uipack components.

`@frontmcp/uipack` ships a bundler that transpiles HTML and React widgets before they reach MCP clients. The runtime lazily loads `esbuild` so the compiler is optional unless you actually build UI components.

<Info>
`BaseBuilder` imports `esbuild` dynamically via `await import(/* webpackIgnore: true */ 'esbuild')`, preventing the compiler from being bundled with FrontMCP itself. Only the process that compiles your widgets needs to install `esbuild`, which keeps your dependency graph light.
</Info>

### Install esbuild before building

<Note>
If you try to transpile components without `esbuild`, the builder throws:

```
esbuild is required for UI component transpilation but is not installed. ... To fix, install esbuild: npm install esbuild
```

Install `esbuild` as a dev dependency so the builder can load it whenever you request a build.

</Note>

```bash
npm install --save-dev esbuild
```

### Sanitized error output

`ComponentBuilder` now rewrites bundler errors with `path.basename` and a regex that strips absolute paths, so failure messages focus on the file you control. For example, a failure now reports:

```
Bundle failed for weather-form.ts: Unexpected token '<'
```

instead of leaking `/home/runner/work/frontmcp/frontmcp/libs/uipack/src/...` or `C:\repo\frontmcp\...`.

<Info>
The sanitizer handles both POSIX and Windows separators, ensuring CI logs never expose internal directory structures even when esbuild surfaces deep stack traces.
</Info>

<Tip>
When you upgrade FrontMCP or esbuild, keep an eye on these sanitized filenames—they stay consistent across platforms, which makes it easier to find the offending source file.
