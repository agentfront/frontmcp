Authorization determines **what** a token may do.

## OAuth scopes

Provide standard scopes to external IdPs:

```ts
auth: {
  type: 'remote',
  name: 'frontegg',
  baseUrl: 'https://idp.example.com',
  scopes: ['openid','profile','email']
}
```

## Tool/resource/prompt consent

Set `consent: true` to display a **post‑login consent** listing your registered **tools/resources/prompts**. The issued access token includes the selected grants.

## Modes (Remote OAuth)

Use the `mode` field to reflect deployment topology:

- `transparent` (default): your server acts as a regular confidential client.
- `orchestrated`: gateway coordinates multiple apps/providers under one umbrella token (used in advanced multi‑app setups).

<Warning>When `splitByApp: true`, configure auth **per app**; server‑level `auth` is disallowed.</Warning>

## Token lifetimes & sessions

- **Stateful sessions**: tokens are encrypted server‑side; clients hold a lightweight reference. Smooth refresh.
- **Stateless sessions**: tokens ride inside JWT; simple but no silent refresh of upstream tokens.
