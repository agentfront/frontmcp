title: Add OpenAPI Adapter
slug: guides/add-openapi-adapter
---

Generate tools automatically from an OpenAPI spec at runtime.

Overview
- Attach the OpenAPI adapter to an app; it fetches the spec and exposes operations as tools.
- Input schema is derived from operation parameters/body via JSON Schema → Zod conversion.

Steps
1. Add the adapter to your app with a URL to the OpenAPI JSON.
2. Optionally configure include/exclude (future), naming, and dereference behavior.

Example (pseudocode)
```
import OpenapiAdapter from '@frontmcp/adapters/openapi'

@FrontMcpApp({
  id: 'expense-2',
  name: 'Expense MCP 2',
  adapters: [
    OpenapiAdapter.init({
      name: 'mock-expense-server',
      url: 'https://example.com/openapi.json',
    })
  ],
})
export default class ExpenseMcpApp {}
```

Notes
- Adapter-generated tools inherit plugins and providers defined on the app.
- At runtime, each generated tool validates inputs using derived schemas.
- See the expenses example for a working setup.
