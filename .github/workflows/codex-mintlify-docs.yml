          You are Codex. Task: propose minimal, precise updates to our **Mintlify** docs (under `docs/docs/`), our root `CHANGELOG.md`, READMEs, and the Mintlify navigation (`docs/docs.json`) for the current release.

          INPUTS (read-only files in workspace):
          - Unified diff:              `.github/codex/prompts/diff.patch`
          - Commit list (TSV):         `.github/codex/prompts/commits.txt`        # columns: sha<TAB>subject<TAB>body
          - Release version:           `.github/codex/prompts/version.txt`        # e.g., 0.3.1
          - Release minor:             `.github/codex/prompts/version-minor.txt`  # e.g., 0.3
          - Release date (UTC, ISO):   `.github/codex/prompts/date.txt`           # e.g., 2025-11-13

          DOCS LAYOUT & VERSIONING

          Folders:
          - `docs/docs/**`
            - The canonical **latest** docs for the current minor (`version-minor.txt`).
            - Paths in Mintlify nav for the latest docs use the `docs/...` prefix (e.g., `"docs/getting-started/welcome"`).
          - `docs/v/<minor>/**`
            - **Archived** docs for older minor versions, e.g.:
              - `docs/v/0.2/**`
              - `docs/v/0.1/**`
            - These are **read-only** for this workflow. Do **NOT** modify or create files under `docs/v/**`.
          - `docs/draft/docs/**`
            - Draft docs used as a base when authoring the next iteration.
            - You may **read** these for context but must **not** modify them.
          - `docs/blogs/**`
            - Blog posts. These must **not** be modified or created by Codex.

          - `docs/updates.mdx`
            - Shared/global release notes page (Mintlify route `updates`), independent of version folders.

          SCOPE & PATHS

          You are allowed to modify/create only:

          - Latest version docs:
            - `docs/docs/**/*.mdx`
            - `docs/docs/**/*.md`
          - Shared global release notes:
            - `docs/updates.mdx`
          - Navigation:
            - `docs/docs.json`
          - Changelog:
            - `CHANGELOG.md`
          - Root README:
            - `README.md`
          - Library READMEs:
            - `libs/**/README.md`

          You must **not** touch:
          - `docs/v/**` (archived versioned docs)
          - `docs/draft/docs/**`
          - `docs/blogs/**`
          or any other file types outside the allowed list.

          RULES – RELEASE NOTES (`docs/updates.mdx`)

          - Add a new section at the **top** for `v<version>` with date `<YYYY-MM-DD>`.
          - Summarize notable user-facing changes derived from commits and diff.
          - Group items under: Breaking changes, Features, Fixes, Docs, Performance, Refactor, Build/CI (omit empty groups).
          - Keep MDX valid (frontmatter/imports/components).

          RULES – LATEST DOCS (`docs/docs/**`)

          - Treat `docs/docs/` as the **canonical docs root for the current minor** (`version-minor.txt`).
          - When updating or creating docs, stay inside `docs/docs/` and keep structure consistent with what already exists there.
          - Do **not** modify `docs/v/**` or `docs/draft/docs/**`.
          - Keep tone and style consistent with existing docs.

          RULES – NAVIGATION (`docs/docs.json`)

          Structure:
          - The root has a `dropdowns` array.
          - There is at least:
            - One dropdown with `"dropdown": "Documentation"`, containing:
              - `"icon": "book"`
              - `"versions": [ ... ]`
            - One dropdown with `"dropdown": "Blog"`, containing blog groups.

          You MUST:
          - Only modify the `"Documentation"` dropdown and its `versions` array.
          - **Do not** modify the `"Blog"` dropdown or any blog navigation.

          Versions:
          - The documentation dropdown has a `versions` array similar to:

            ```jsonc
            {
              "dropdown": "Documentation",
              "icon": "book",
              "versions": [
                {
                  "version": "v0.3 (latest)",
                  "default": true,
                  "groups": [ ... paths like "docs/getting-started/welcome", "updates", ... ]
                },
                {
                  "version": "v0.2",
                  "groups": [ ... paths like "docs/v/0.2/getting-started/welcome" ... ]
                },
                {
                  "version": "v0.1",
                  "groups": [ ... ]
                }
              ]
            }
            ```

          Semantics:
          - The **latest minor** (matching `version-minor.txt`) must:
            - Appear as the first entry in `versions`.
            - Have `"version": "v<minor> (latest)"` (e.g., `"v0.3 (latest)"`).
            - Have `"default": true`.
            - Use paths **without** the `/v/<minor>` prefix (latest routes):
              - e.g., `"docs/getting-started/welcome"`, `"docs/servers/server"`, `"updates"`.
          - Older minors (archived) must:
            - Use `"version": "v<minor>"` (no “(latest)”).
            - Have **no** `"default": true` (or explicitly `false`).
            - Use paths that start with `docs/v/<minor>/...`:
              - e.g., `"docs/v/0.2/getting-started/welcome"`.

          When the current `version-minor.txt` **already matches** the existing latest entry:
          - Example: latest entry is `"v0.3 (latest)"` and `version-minor.txt` is `0.3`.
          - Treat this release as a **patch** within the same minor.
          - Keep the `"v0.3 (latest)"` entry as the default.
          - Add or adjust page entries within that entry’s `groups` so that every new/renamed doc file under `docs/docs/` is reflected in `pages`.
          - Do **not** add or modify entries for `docs/v/**`.

          If `version-minor.txt` does **not** match the minor in the current “(latest)” entry:
          - You may adjust labels (e.g., text like `"v0.3 (latest)"` → `"v0.3"`) and create a new `"v<minor> (latest)"` entry.
          - However, **do not** create or modify `docs/v/**` files; the archived folders are managed outside this workflow.
          - Assume that any needed `docs/v/<oldMinor>/...` content is created separately.
          - Your responsibility is to ensure:
            - The **latest** entry refers to `docs/...` paths and matches `version-minor.txt`.
            - Older entries refer to `docs/v/<minor>/...` paths and are correctly labeled.

          Tags:
          - You may see `tag` fields like `"latest"` or `"version 0.2"` on groups.
          - Preserve and update them logically:
            - The latest version can have `tag: "latest"`.
            - Older versions can have `tag: "version <minor>"` (e.g., `"version 0.2"`).
          - Do not introduce noisy or inconsistent tags.

          Keep `docs/docs.json`:
          - Valid JSON.
          - As close as reasonable to existing formatting (but correctness > formatting).

          RULES – CHANGELOG (`CHANGELOG.md`)

          - Follow Keep a Changelog style.
          - Add a new section at the top with heading:
            - `## [v<version>] - <YYYY-MM-DD>`
          - Categorize entries using Conventional Commits (feat/fix/docs/perf/refactor/build/ci/chore) and mark **BREAKING CHANGES** clearly.
          - Use short, imperative bullets; avoid internal-only noise.

          RULES – ROOT README (`README.md`)

          - Update only if there are meaningful repo-level changes for this release.
          - Ensure:
            - Install commands, quickstart snippets, and any mentioned versions are accurate for the current release.
            - Top-level feature overview is up-to-date.
          - If there are no meaningful changes, leave it unchanged.

          RULES – LIBRARY READMEs (`libs/**/README.md`)

          - Focus on libs that are clearly user-facing or affected by the diff:
            - Their code changed.
            - Their `package.json` version changed.
            - Commits explicitly mention them.
          - For each updated README:
            - Ensure install instructions are correct (package name, registry, version ranges if relevant).
            - Update usage examples and API sections to match current behavior.
            - Optionally highlight notable changes that impact consumers.
          - Keep Markdown simple and valid; avoid large rewrites unless the current content is clearly misleading.

          GENERAL

          - Prefer small, surgical edits.
          - Never modify:
            - `docs/v/**`
            - `docs/draft/docs/**`
            - `docs/blogs/**`
          - Always keep:
            - `docs/docs.json` consistent with actual docs under `docs/docs/`.
            - `docs/updates.mdx` and `CHANGELOG.md` consistent in terms of high-level content (but adapted tone).
          - If no changes are needed, return an empty patch set.

          OUTPUT (STRICT)

          - Return JSON that matches the output schema provided by the runner.
          - Each patch replaces the entire file content.

          HINTS

          - Use subjects/bodies in `commits.txt` to infer categories; de-duplicate merges.
          - If the same content belongs in multiple places (e.g., `docs/updates.mdx`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and a lib’s README), adapt tone:
            - docs = narrative highlights,
            - changelog = terse, categorized bullets,
            - README = practical “how to use this” guidance and upgrade notes.
